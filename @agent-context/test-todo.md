# Test Agent Context - TODO App (@test-todo)

## Current Focus
- Setting up comprehensive test infrastructure for TODO app
- Creating unit, integration, and E2E test suites
- Establishing 90%+ test coverage target

## Key Decisions
- Using Vitest for unit/integration tests (fast, ESM support)
- Playwright for E2E tests (cross-browser testing)
- Separate test databases for isolation
- No mocking in integration tests (per shared decisions)

## Work Log
### 2025-01-17
- ✅ Created comprehensive test infrastructure
- ✅ Set up Vitest for unit/integration tests (already installed)
- ✅ Configured Playwright for E2E tests
- ✅ Created test fixtures and utilities
- ✅ Built test helpers for API testing
- ✅ Created E2E page object models
- ✅ Implemented performance test suite
- ✅ Created test data seeders
- ✅ Wrote comprehensive test documentation

### 2025-06-17
- ✅ Created comprehensive backend integration tests:
  - todo.integration.test.ts - Full CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, pagination
  - category.integration.test.ts - Category management and TODO relationships
  - tag.integration.test.ts - Tag functionality, popularity tracking, filtering
  - websocket.integration.test.ts - Real-time events, connection handling
  - performance.integration.test.ts - Response time benchmarks, load testing
  - export.integration.test.ts - CSV, PDF, JSON, Markdown export functionality
- ✅ Created cross-service integration tests:
  - Full authentication flow testing
  - UI-API synchronization testing
  - Real-time multi-session updates
  - Export functionality from UI
  - Performance and concurrent operation handling
- ✅ Achieved comprehensive test coverage:
  - All API endpoints tested
  - Error scenarios covered
  - Security validations tested
  - Performance benchmarks established
  - Real-time functionality verified

### Test Coverage Strategy
- Unit tests: Component/function level testing
- Integration tests: API endpoint testing with real DB
- E2E tests: Full user journey testing
- Performance tests: Load testing and metrics

## Questions for Other Agents
- @backend: What's the database schema for TODOs?
- @frontend: What UI components need unit tests?
- @fullstack: Any specific user journeys to prioritize for E2E?

## Useful Patterns
- Test data builders for consistent test data
- Custom Playwright commands for common actions
- Vitest custom matchers for API responses

## Next Steps
1. Install testing dependencies
2. Configure Vitest for both frontend and backend
3. Set up Playwright for E2E tests
4. Create test data seeders
5. Write initial test suites
