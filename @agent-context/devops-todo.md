# DevOps Agent Context - TODO App Deployment

**Agent**: @devops-todo
**Created**: 2025-01-17
**Focus**: Deploying TODO application to free cloud providers

## Current Mission
Deploy a TODO application with:
- Backend + PostgreSQL on Render.com (free tier)
- Frontend on Vercel/Netlify
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Monitoring with Sentry (free tier)

## Technical Decisions
- Use Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Render.com for backend (includes PostgreSQL)
- Vercel for frontend deployment
- Sentry for error tracking

## Work Log
- [2025-01-17] Started deployment setup for TODO app
- Found existing comprehensive Docker setup with health checks
- Created GitHub Actions workflows:
  - CI/CD pipeline (ci.yml) - already existed
  - Render deployment (deploy-render.yml)
  - Vercel deployment (deploy-vercel.yml)  
  - Database backup automation (backup-database.yml)
- Created deployment configurations:
  - render.yaml for Render deployment
  - vercel.json for Vercel deployment
- Set up monitoring with Sentry configurations
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - deployment-guide.md
  - troubleshooting-guide.md

## Completed Tasks
✅ Docker configurations with health checks (already existed)
✅ CI/CD workflows for GitHub Actions
✅ Render deployment configuration
✅ Vercel deployment configuration
✅ Database backup strategy and automation
✅ Sentry monitoring setup
✅ Deployment documentation
✅ Troubleshooting guide

## Questions/Blockers
- None currently - all deployment infrastructure is ready

## Next Steps
- Users need to:
  1. Create accounts on Render and Vercel
  2. Set up GitHub secrets for deployment
  3. Configure Sentry projects
  4. Run initial deployment
