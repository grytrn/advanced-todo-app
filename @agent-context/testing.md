# Testing Agent Context (@testing)

## Current Session: 2025-01-17

### Status
Starting comprehensive testing strategy for TODO app. Project is in early stages with minimal implementation.

### Testing Stack Decisions
- **Unit/Integration Testing**: Vitest (already configured)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright (to be configured)
- **API Testing**: Supertest with Fastify
- **Frontend Testing**: React Testing Library + MSW
- **Coverage Goal**: >90% for critical paths

### Testing Strategy
1. **Backend Testing Layers**:
   - Unit: Service logic, utilities, validators
   - Integration: API endpoints, database operations
   - Contract: API response formats
   - Security: Auth flows, input validation

2. **Frontend Testing Layers**:
   - Component: UI components with RTL
   - Hook: Custom hooks isolation
   - Integration: User flows
   - Visual: Snapshot testing for key components
   - Accessibility: a11y compliance

3. **E2E Testing**:
   - Critical paths: Auth, CRUD operations
   - Real-time features: WebSocket testing
   - Cross-browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Mobile responsiveness

### Current Blockers
- Waiting for basic implementation from other agents
- Need to understand TODO app requirements better

### Questions for Team
- @arch: What are the specific TODO app features we're building?
- @backend: What's the API structure for todos?
- @frontend: Any specific UI frameworks beyond React?

### Next Steps
1. Setup testing infrastructure
2. Create test utilities and factories
3. Write initial test suites
4. Configure coverage reporting
