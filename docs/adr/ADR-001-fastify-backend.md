## Status
Accepted

## Date

## Context
We need to choose a Node.js web framework for our backend API. The framework needs to be:
- Fast and performant for handling high loads
- Well-maintained with active community
- TypeScript-first or with excellent TypeScript support
- Built-in validation and serialization
- Good developer experience

## Decision
We will use Fastify as our backend web framework.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: 2x faster than Express in benchmarks
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript support with type providers
- **Schema Validation**: Built-in JSON Schema validation
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem with official plugins
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent error messages and debugging
- **Async/Await**: Native support without wrapper

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Less familiar than Express for most developers
- **Ecosystem Size**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Express
- **Documentation**: Some plugins have limited documentation

### Risks
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Not all Express middleware works with Fastify
  - *Mitigation*: Fastify has adapters for Express middleware when needed
- **Team Familiarity**: Team may need time to learn Fastify patterns
  - *Mitigation*: Provide examples and establish patterns early

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Express
- **Description**: The most popular Node.js framework
- **Pros**: Huge ecosystem, familiar to all developers, extensive documentation
- **Cons**: Slower performance, no built-in validation, requires many plugins
- **Reason for rejection**: Performance is critical for our use case

### Alternative 2: Koa
- **Description**: Minimalist framework from Express team
- **Pros**: Very lightweight, modern async/await support
- **Cons**: Too minimal, requires extensive setup, smaller ecosystem
- **Reason for rejection**: Would require too much custom implementation

### Alternative 3: NestJS
- **Description**: Full-featured framework with Angular-like architecture
- **Pros**: Batteries included, great for large teams, excellent structure
- **Cons**: Heavy abstraction, opinionated, steep learning curve
- **Reason for rejection**: Over-engineered for our needs

## Implementation Details
- Use Fastify v4.x (latest stable)
- Implement custom error handler
- Use official plugins for CORS, JWT, rate limiting
- Create TypeScript schemas for all routes
- Use Fastify's built-in logging with Pino

## Notes
- Update @tech-stack import with this decision
- Create example patterns for common use cases
- Consider Fastify-specific training for team
